My Shark Project is a simple tool I am building to teach myself coding.
It will hopefully be a tool that helps users learn to identify marine animals, as much as it is a tool to help me learn:
<ul>
<li>HTML</li>
<li>CSS</li>
<li>JavaScript</li>
</ul>

The idea is to show an image, let the user identify the species, and give them feedback. Eventually I want to build in levels with increasing difficulty and scoring.
